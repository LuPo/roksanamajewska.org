	abstract = {The first reports of diatoms growing on marine mammals date back to the early 1900s. However, only recently has direct evidence been provided for similar associations between diatoms and sea turtles. We present a comparison of diatom communities inhabiting carapaces of green turtles Chelonia mydas sampled at two remote sites located within the Indian (Iran) and Atlantic (Costa Rica) Ocean basins. Diatom observations and counts were carried out using scanning electron microscopy. Techniques involving critical point drying enabled observations of diatoms and other microepibionts still attached to sea turtle carapace and revealed specific aspects of the epizoic community structure. Species-poor, well-developed diatom communities were found on all examined sea turtles. Significant differences between the two host sea turtle populations were observed in terms of diatom abundance and their community structure (including growth form structure). A total of 12 and 22 diatom taxa were found from sea turtles in Iran and Costa Rica, respectively, and eight of these species belonging to Amphora, Chelonicola, Cocconeis, Navicula, Nitzschia and Poulinea genera were observed in samples from both locations. Potential mechanisms of diatom dispersal and the influence of the external environment, sea turtle behaviour, its life stage, and foraging and breeding habitats, as well as epibiotic bacterial flora on epizoic communities, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The diatom genus Proschkinia is a common element of biofilms covering diverse substrata in saline inland or shallow coastal environments. It can be distinguished from other naviculoid taxa by its lanceolate valves with a fistula located within the central area and numerous open girdle bands with a U-shaped cross-section and a single row of perforations on the internal side of the fold. Despite this distinct morphology, frustules of Proschkinia are typically weakly silicified and often overlooked when cleaned diatom material is analysed. The current paper describes six new species of Proschkinia: P. browderiana sp. nov., P. lacrimula sp. nov., P. maluszekiana sp. nov., P. sulcata sp. nov., P. torquata sp. nov. and P. vergostriata sp. nov., found in numerous samples of marine organisms, such as sea turtles (including sea turtle museum specimens), sea turtle-associated barnacles and seagrass from across the three oceans. Some of the newly described taxa were found on multiple individuals belonging to different sea turtle species, whereas others were in samples collected from different continents. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that examined Proschkinia strains formed a monophyletic clade, sister to Fistulifera.},

	abstract = {Several populations of a new Craspedostauros species were observed on museum specimens of juvenile green turtle and Kemp’s ridleys collected from Long Island Beach, New York, {USA}. The new taxon, Craspedostauros alatus Majewska \& Ashworth sp. nov., exhibits a distinctive set of morphological features typical of the genus, including cribrate areolae, a stauros narrower than the fascia, multiple doubly perforated girdle bands, and two fore and aft chloroplasts, but clearly differs from all known Craspedostauros species in possessing partially fused proximal helictoglossae forming an internal thickening with a shallow central cavity, distinctive external wing-like silica flaps near the apices, and a combination of valve dimensions and stria density not observed in other taxa. The same taxon was identified in the {NCMA} culture collection (strain {CCMP}120), isolated in 1967 from a sample collected from the equatorial upwelling zone in the Pacific Ocean. Nine samples from three sea turtle species were collected from the same location (Long Island Beach). Statistical analyses suggested that the epizoic diatom flora composition was not affected by the collection season but differed among sea turtle species. The most significant difference was observed between the samples with and without C. alatus. Samples with C. alatus were always dominated by Achnanthes elongata and Berkeleya cf. rutilans, while those lacking the new taxon were characterized by remarkably higher contributions of epizoic Poulinea species. This observation suggests that the microhabitat provided by each sea turtle differs among specimens, which may be related to the different stages of biofilm development on the host sea turtle. Additionally, the value of zoological museum collections for epizoic diatom surveys is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Although diatoms colonize a vast diversity of immersed hard-surfaced objects and organisms, many diatom species, and sometimes entire genera, show a clear preference towards a particular type of substratum. Studies of animal-associated diatoms indicate that some epizoic forms may require this specific habitat to thrive, and new diatom taxa are expected to be found on as yet unexplored animal hosts. The current study is the first to investigate the diatom flora of sea snakes. Three museum specimens of yellow-bellied sea snakes (Hydrophis platurus) collected over a period of 23 years from the south-eastern coast of South Africa were examined for their diatom flora. Diatoms were abundant on the sea snakes, but communities were composed of only a few species. A previously undescribed species of Nagumoea contributed over 99\% of the total diatom assemblage on both the sea snake skin and sea-snake-associated barnacles (Octolasmis sp.). This diatom dominant is described here as Nagumoea hydrophicola sp. nov., based on detailed observations of its frustule ultrastructure using light and scanning electron microscopy. The species is most similar to N. serrata, sharing a similar valvocopula morphology with two rows of pores. However, it can be distinguished from all currently known congeners by its lanceolate central area, short distal raphe endings not reaching the valve mantle, and doubly perforated abvalvar girdle bands. Environmental preferences of the new species are discussed in the context of its host’s biology.},
